                <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> When we last thought about cookies (Sept. 15th 2025 3:06 A.M.)</p>
                <p><strong>Cookie count:</strong> Fewer than you think</p>

            <p>Welcome to our Cookie Policy! Unlike real cookies, these digital cookies won't make you fat or give you diabetes. But they might track what you're doing on our site. Delicious, right?</p>

            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

            <p>Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer. They're like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Digital breadcrumbs (Hansel and Gretel would approve)</li>
                <li>Website memory (we forget things easily)</li>
                <li>Tracking pixels (but not the creepy kind)</li>
                <li>Local storage (but smaller)</li>
                <li>Website memory (we forget things easily)</li>
                <li>Uniquely you (so you dont appear as someone else)</li>
                <li>Website memory (we forget things easily)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
