                <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> Whenever we feel like it (probably never) (Sept. 15th 2025 3:25 A.M.)</p>
                <p><strong>Effective:</strong> Before you even read this</p>
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy! We're HeadlessRyn, and we take your privacy very seriously. By "very seriously," we mean we might look at it once in a while when we're bored.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>What We Actually Collect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
                <li> </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What We Pretend to Collect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your credit card information (nah, we're not that fancy)</li>
                <li>Your social security number (we don't even know ours)</li>
                <li>Your browsing history from other sites (that's creepy)</li>
                <li>Your location (unless you tell us, then maybe)</li>
                <li>Your IP address (because the internet told us to)</li>
                <li>What pages you visit (we're nosy like that)</li>
                <li>How long you stay (please don't leave, we get lonely)</li>
                <li>Your browser type (Chrome, Firefox, or that weird one you're using)</li>
                <li>Whether you have JavaScript enabled (spoiler: you probably do)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>We use your information in the following ways:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>To make the website work:</strong> Because otherwise it'd just be a blank page (it would work regardless)</li>
                <li><strong>To improve our site:</strong> Based on what you click, or don't click (again, doesnt matter)</li>
                <li><strong>To send you updates:</strong> If we ever have any, don't hold your breath (flat out lie)</li>
                <li><strong>To comply with laws:</strong> When absolutely necessary (are you sensing a pattern)</li>
                <li><strong>To debug issues:</strong> When things break (which they 100% will, but again, we literally dont use or collect anything)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

            <p>We don't share your data with third parties because:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We're too lazy to set up partnerships</li>
                <li>Who would want our minimal traffic data anyway?</li>
                <li>We value your privacy (said no website ever, yes im aware i already made this joke)</li>
                <li>We don't have any advertisers (because no one wants to advertise here)</li>
                <li>We don't even have connections (we wish tho)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>EXCEPTION: If legally required, we might share data. But let's be real, no one's coming after us except ourselves.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>

                <li>SSL encryption (because HTTPS is cool)</li>
                <li>Our password (which is probably "password123")</li>
                <li>The fact that no one really wants our data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <p>You have the right to:</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            <p>If you're under 13, please don't use this site. If you're under 18, your parents probably don't know you're here. If you're over 18, genuinely what the hell are you doing here?</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

            <p>We may update this policy whenever we feel like it. We'll try to update the date at the top, but no promises.</p>
